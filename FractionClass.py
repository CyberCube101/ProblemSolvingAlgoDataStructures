## This works but doesnt provide answer in l.c.d. Here we can use Euclids Algorithm

# Euclidâ€™s Algorithm states that the greatest common divisor of two integers m and n is n if n divides m evenly.
# However, if n does not divide m evenly, then the answer is the greatest common divisor of n and the remainder of m divided by n.
